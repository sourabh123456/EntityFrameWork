# EntityFrameWork
**EF Core support different DB Engines**
1. Sql server
2. Ms Sql
3. Oracle
4. Postgres

**Approaches to Work with Entity FrameWork**
1. **Code First:** We can create the (domain) model classes first, then database from the model classes.
2. **Database First:** We have database created already, then we can create domain model classed from that.
